# MyRpackage

A collection of pretty useless R functions put together to practice building and supporting package development!

### Functions

`sq()` - draws a square

`circ()` - doesn't do anything much at all at the moment - but it _will_ draw a circle, somehow, someday...

`tri()` - contains some suspect code, might do something, might not!
